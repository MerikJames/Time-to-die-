            I served my mission from 2019-2021 in the beautiful state of Florida.
            My Mission was the Florida Fort Lauderdale Mission, and I spent about
            a year and a half serving in the greater city of Miami. It was quite the
            experience! I was a Spanish-speaking missionary and had the chance to
            teach and baptize families from almost every country south of the US,
            excluding Brazil. I taught a lot of people who fled their nations because of financial difficulty. Hit this <a href="../Tableau/Tableau.html"> link</a> 
            to go to see more about this, its an interesting subject!
